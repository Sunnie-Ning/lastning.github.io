## The multi-panel heatmap
Here is a multi-figure heatmap for all the prostitution population from year 2003 to 2013, interestingly, by drawing the heatmap I found there was no record in prostitution data after 2014, which might due to data shortage.

Overall, based on the heatmap, we can see the population of prostitution in Northern is gradually decreasing while Mission always has the most biggest population for prostitution, which might be something the polices should notice.
